a0-a7

at address 26, but compiler inline the function and optimize the constant value, so the function call is evaluate to 12.

printf function at 0x628 addresss

ra(return address) is 38

0x00646c72 at little endian is 0x726c6400, so the string is "rld\0"
57616 to hex is 0xe110
so printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i); will output "He110 World"
if using big-endian, we need change int i = 0x726c6400, but don't have to change the 57616.

the second %d will continue read the stack, so we don't know what it will print. It's an undefined behavior.
